 *
 * Measuring time with kaizen_frame_time can be unreliable on certain
 * platforms (Win32) if the thread which measures time gets 
 * scheduled to another processor core so start and stop times are
 * measured on different cores.
 *
 * To minimize the chance for wrong time measurements initialize 
 * a kaizen_raw_reliable_frame_time_scope before measuring time and
 * finalize if after all measurments relative to the first one are done.
 *
 * A reliability scope can be embedded into an outer scope but inner scopes
 * must be initialized and finished inside the outer scopes. It is best to
 * only have one reliability scope open as long as needed.
 *
 * Opening and closing a kaizen_raw_reliable_frame_time_scope is costly on
 * some platforms and changes the way threads are scheduled on some platforms
 * therefore don't initialize and finalize scopes too often but also do not
 * keep them open too long as the thread scheduling might be affected.
 *
 * If the threads are controlled by a thread or task pool and the thread/task
 * pool already set the thread affinity it isn't necessary to use
 * kaizen_reliable_frame_time_scope_init and _finalize.
 *
